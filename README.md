### Description
This is My biggest personal projects. I'm a huge reader of fanfics and the current sites are lacking.

The idea behind is to be able to save all my favorites fandoms fanfics so I have a backup in case it got deleted.

The second goal is to know what I already read while browsing on site, which is none exist on the big sites.

The third goal is that all the data of the fanfics will be in one place so i won't have to search in 3 different sites.

So I scraped the 3 biggest Fanfics sites (AO3, FF, Wattpad) and built my own platform to use the data.

### Features
- Scraping and Merging massive amount of data
- Users System with priority (regular user/ manager): Registrer/Login/Status Tracker/Reading List/Favorites...
- DB - filter/sort/CRUD
- Manager area built with socket to control the downloader in server
- Authentication System
- Email System
- Gallery Mode
- PDF/Epub reader for automatic data grabber
- Compareing and Merging Data

And Much More...

## And In More Detailed words:

### How I built the site?
"My Fanfic Library" site was built as a react learning site.

The Client side was build with react+redux+material ui

The Server side was build with node js + express.

I'ts all Hosted on my own Centos Server.

Working with Jira to Manage the features/Bugs for the site.

### Why did I built the site?
I choose to built this site because I really love to read fanfics but I have a couple of issues with the sites I'm reading my fanfics from:

#### General Issues
- Create one place that will contain all of the fanfics I read (fanfic data + fanfic files for backup) - will include AO3, FF, Wattpad & Tumblr
- Create user buttons (Follow,Finished,Ignore...) which are easy to understand and use (and see them during a search)
- Backup all the fanfics Automaticlly
- Have statistics about my reading
- Follow fanfics without getting email everytime it got update
- Ignore fanfics that I know I'm not gonna read - so I won't see them on my search
#### AO3
- My Main problem is that while searching for a fanfic I can't know if I already read it or not , only by bookmarks (after entering the fanfic page) and in bookmark by special tags
- The site design is too "old" even thougth its the most comptable to read fanfics like that , I still want to see images
- I don't care about all the fandoms in the world just specific
- There are a lot of fanfics that got deletd from site and I want to have a backup for them
#### FF
- I only read there very little fanfics so I want to follow them and see them in one place with my other fanfics
- Check if they already exist in ao3 so maybe I already read them
#### Wattpad
- I only read there very little fanfics so I want to follow them and see them in one place with my other fanfics
- The design of the site is way better but it so uncomptable to read there the stories - I want to save them as epun/pdf... and then read
Tumblr/Patreon
-I only read there very little fanfics so I want to follow them and see them in one place with my other fanfics
There are a lot of short stories there - I want to save them to one place and as epub/pdf...
