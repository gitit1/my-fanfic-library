To me she's always been the unsung hero of the show - so after a tonne of research (cast/crew interviews, clone reports book, official comics, other fan theories) I decided to write the story myself. The plan is to start from looking at how she initially got involved with all this mess and take it in chronological order right through to the end of the series (maybe slightly after?), including things like her boarding school days, early betrayal of Cosima, what she got up to with DYAD and on the island after her shooting. I'll be adding a new chapter every other week (this may be more/less frequently from time to time depending on how busy I am).
