And when both Maggie and Alex start dreaming about the moments fate brought them together, the moments replaying very differently to how they remember them, their waking relationship starts to break down.\nTrying to cope with a city drowning under the weight of a new illicit substance on the drug scene and a DEO too stretched to rebuild all the damage as quickly as it\u2019s needed, our two favourite heroines find themselves pulling further and further away from each other, losing track of what is real and what isn\u2019t.\n", "Language": "English", "Author": "Heligena", "URL": "https://archiveofourown.org/works/12316389", "Favorite": "NO", "Last_Update_Of_Note": "29/05/2019 14:13:25", "Comments": "41", "Last_Update": "09/10/2017", "Fanfic_Title": "Love is a Poison Wilfully Consumed", "Number_of_Chapters": "13", "Author_URL": "/users/Heligena/pseuds/Heligena", "Words": "47,448", "Saved_Fic": "NO", "Chapter_Status": "", "Complete": "YES"}, {"Status": "Need To Read", "Hits": "22191", "Kudos": "541", "Description": "Takes place after 2x07, when Maggie asks to just be friends.\nThe awkward aftermath of the kiss and the rejection.
